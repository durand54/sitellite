<h1>SiteMailer Message Templates</h1>

<p>SiteMailer allows you to use templates to add branding to your messages.  These templates live in the inc/app/sitemailer/html/templates folder, and can be selected when you are composing a message.</p>

<p>Templates are written in the SimpleTemplate language.  A default template, named default.spt, is provided as an example.</p>

<p>Once you have created a new template and saved it to the inc/app/sitemailer/html/templates folder, it will automatically appear in the list of available templates when composing messages in SiteMailer.</p>

<p>Please note that the templates are generated only once ahead of time, and so they cannot contain any personalized information for each subscriber.  This is functionality slated for SiteMailer 2.</p>
