<h1>Installation</h1>

Usage:<br />
<br />
Install into inc/app/webfiles folder.  Access via:<br />
<br />
http://www.example.com/index/webfiles-app<br />
<br />
Requires a valid Sitellite login.<br />
<br />
Status:<br />
<br />
Development has been halted, although it is very close to working.<br />
WebDAV does not seem to be a stable solution for remote file access,<br />
so we're focusing instead on the Sitellite Desktop and integrating<br />
that with our own custom REST API for Web Files that supports all<br />
of the same operations as WebDAV, but which we control at the API<br />
and design level.  The Web Files REST API will also be easier to<br />
support and extend with future ideas like versioning, whereas<br />
the WebDAV versioning extension is ill-supported by the majority<br />
of popular clients and servers.<br />
<br />
Litmus tests:<br />
<br />
- basic 15/15 passed<br />
- copymove 13/13 passed<br />
- props 22/30 passed (not officially supporting custom properties)<br />
- locks 20/30 passed (they do seem to be working correctly via cadaver)<br />
- http 4/4 passed<br />
<br />
Clients:<br />
<br />
Cadaver<br />
<br />
- No known issues<br />
<br />
Transmit<br />
<br />
- No known issues<br />
<br />
OSX<br />
<br />
- "File already exists" error on PUT for any uppercase file names.<br />
  Results in a zero-byte file uploaded.  In Web Files, names are<br />
  changed to lowercase because MySQL select is case-insensitive<br />
  and Web Files depends on that for versioning and other features.<br />
- Stores dot-files outside of Web Files collection, just in the<br />
  filesystem, so they don't pollute the file list for other users.<br />
<br />
Windows<br />
<br />
- Not thoroughly tested, but the only known issue is direct editing<br />
  fails (edit through a program or right-click to open).  Download,<br />
  drag 'n' drop, upload, etc. all work fine.<br />
- Make sure to connect using dav@ to specify username or Windows will<br />
  revert to an unsupported authentication scheme.  Still had to go<br />
  through the username/password prompt 3 times before it took (same<br />
  creds each time, *sigh*).<br />
<br />
Webdrive (3rd party Windows client)<br />
<br />
- No known issues<br />
<br />
Misc:<br />
<br />
- Not yet tested with https<br />
- Copy/move folders only goes 2 levels, not recursive<br />
