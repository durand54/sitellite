<h1>The SiteLinks Admin UI</h1>

SiteLinks comes with a built-in statistic screen, which shows you the
top viewed links, the top click-throughs, and the top rated links as
well.&nbsp; You can view each of these for any day, month, or year.<br />
<br />
The SiteLinks admin user-interface also tells you if there are any
pending user-contributed submissions for you to approve, how many, and
provides a link for you to view them in the Sitellite content browser.<br />
<br />
The SiteLinks admin user-interface is accessible under the Control Panel &gt; Tools &gt; SiteLinks select box.<br />
