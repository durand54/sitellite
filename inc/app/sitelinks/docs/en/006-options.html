<h1>Configuration Options</h1>

All of the configuration options for SiteLinks are in the
inc/app/sitelinks/conf/properties.php file.&nbsp; Each option has a
description of what it does in the source of the file itself.&nbsp;
Some of the main options include:<br />
<ul>
  <li>Default type - allows you to control which item type the
add/edit/submission forms should default to, globally as well as
per-category.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Item pages - allows you to specify whether listings should have a full-page view, or simply a summary.</li>
  <li>User ratings - whether or not you want users to be able to rate links.</li>
  <li>User submissions - whether or not you want users to be able to contribute links of their own.</li>
  <li>Index screen - what to show on the main screen of the SiteLinks
app.&nbsp; This can be a list of categories, the top rated items, the
most recently added or updated items,or a simple default list, which is useful for single-page link lists (because you don't  <em>have</em> to use SiteLinks to the max to use SiteLinks).</li>
  <li>Category screen - whether to show summaries of the items, or simply a bulleted list to complement the default index screen view.</li>
  <li>Show related - whether to show related items, which are items added by the same contributer.</li>
  <li>RSS links - whether to offer RSS news feed links in the SiteLinks navigation, or you can keep the RSS links private.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
