<h1>Using with JWplayer</h1>

USING SITESTREAMER WITH THE JW FLASH PLAYER<br />
<br />
To install the JW Flash Player into SiteStreamer, replacing the default<br />
flash video player, simply overwrite the sitestreamer/lib/player.swf file<br />
with the JW player and also copy the swfobject.js script into the<br />
sitestreamer/lib folder as well. SiteStreamer will auto-detect that the<br />
swfobject.js script is there, and load the player correctly.<br />
