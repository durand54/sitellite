<h1>Installation</h1>

To install SiteStreamer, simply unzip it to a folder named inc/app/sitestreamer<br />
in your Sitellite installation.Â  There is no additional setup required, as<br />
SiteStreamer is just a wrapper around the Web Files content collection in<br />
Sitellite.<br />
<br />
The commands on Unix systems to unzip the file would be:<br />
<br />
# Unzip the file<br />
tar -zxf sitestreamer-1.0.0-stable.tar.gz<br />
<br />
# Rename the resulting folder<br />
mv sitestreamer-1.0.0-stable sitestreamer<br />
<br />
# Delete the downloaded file<br />
rm sitestreamer-1.0.0-stable.tar.gz<br />
