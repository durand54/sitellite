<br />
Changes in 1.2.0<br />
<br />
- Fixed Java path in java/compile.sh<br />
- Fixed permissions on java/restart.sh<br />
- Fixed a bug causing the deletion of records from the index not to be<br />
  reflected in the search results until the SiteSearch daemon was restarted.<br />
- Added workflow services to automatically add, update, and delete records<br />
  from the SiteSearch index when documents are added or modified in<br />
  Sitellite.  This keeps the SiteSearch index 100% in sync with the<br />
  live web site at all times.<br />
<br />
Changes in 1.0.0<br />
<br />
- Added support for the OpenSearch RSS extension.<br />
<br />
Changes in 0.9.6-rc<br />
<br />
- Patched Conf.java to allow SiteSearch to work with Java 1.3, since<br />
  String.split() is new to 1.4 -- thanks to Oliver for the patch!<br />
- Fixed an invalid object request in the IXR code that caused blank<br />
  pages when the server is stopped.<br />
- Updated several of the PEAR packages used, including Net/Socket,<br />
  Net/URL, and HTTP/Request.<br />
<br />
Changes in 0.9.5-rc<br />
<br />
- Moved importing filters to a global location.  This was causing the<br />
  descriptions to disappear.<br />
- Added script, running.sh, that can be called by cron to check the status<br />
  of the SiteSearch daemon, and auto-restart it if necessary.<br />
- Fixed missing methods in the new IXR 2.0 package.<br />
- Fixed a bug causing the pager to break the search results.<br />
- Added the following characters to the escape list: +-^~.<br />
<br />
Changes in 0.9.4-rc<br />
<br />
- Upgraded the XML-RPC client to the new "Unofficial" IXR 2.0 from<br />
  phppatterns.com, which solved an error I was occasionally getting<br />
  on my development copy (although I'd never seen in on the live sites,<br />
  but better safe than sorry).<br />
- Added a new domains field to the server, allowing you to potentially<br />
  hook up multiple Sitellite sites to the same server by using the same<br />
  settings for each of them.<br />
- Added domain and content type to the logger, and added both of them<br />
  also to the admin stats UI.<br />
- Added a syntax field in the search result metadata, so that you can<br />
  inspect the actual query used by the server.<br />
- Added the syntax to the search accessor in the admin UI.<br />
- Server now properly handles special characters: ![](){}:<br />
<br />
Changes in 0.9.3-rc<br />
<br />
- Fixed a "division by zero" error when viewing the stats page after the<br />
  indexer has been run, but before any searches have been performed.<br />
- Added a built-in mime type list, so that you're not dependent on the<br />
  new mime_content_type() function, or the workaround to it using<br />
  `file -bi $filename`, which is flaky.<br />
- Added link for administrators to view the results of a given search from<br />
  the stats page, without it altering the stats by performing the search.<br />
<br />
Changes in 0.9.2-rc<br />
<br />
- Added content extractor for files.  Handles the following types out of the<br />
  box: Word, Excel, Powerpoint, PDF, vCard, iCal, RTF, HTML, XML, MP3, and<br />
  Photoshop (PSD) files.<br />
- Added bold-ing of search terms in search results.<br />
- Added new documentation:<br />
  - A note to explain how to make highlighting display (CSS for<br />
    span.highlighted)<br />
  - An explanation of the extractor.<br />
  - An overview of the XML-RPC API.<br />
  - FAQ for common problems.<br />
- Improved the security of the server by requiring the keyCode in all<br />
  proper places.<br />
- Added a new script, restart.sh, for restarting the server.<br />
- Added total and average at the bottom of the "Total Searches" stats.<br />
- Changed date formats to display full month names instead of abbreviations.<br />
- Added checking for a sitesearch_access setting in collection config files,<br />
  allowing collections to be restricted from public access.<br />
- Added RSS syndication of search results.  This, plus news/rss/viewer,<br />
  or some custom code based on news/rss/viewer, could make for a powerful<br />
  "Related Forum Posts" or "Related News Stories" feature, or just a new<br />
  way of syndicating your web site content.<br />
- Added checking for a sitesearch_highlight setting in collection config<br />
  files, allowing collections to determine whether they provide highlighting<br />
  support or not.  Default is that they DO.<br />
- Added ctype to the search result property list.<br />
<br />
