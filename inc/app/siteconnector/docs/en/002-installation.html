<h1>Installation</h1>

Getting up and running with SiteConnector is a fast and easy 4-step process:<br />
<br />
1. Create the SiteConnector database tables:<br />
<pre>$ cd /PATH/TO/SITELLITE<br />$ mysql -p -u USER DBNAME &lt; inc/app/siteconnector/install/install-mysql.sql<br />(enter password when prompted)</pre>
2. Define a new SiteConnector resource by either a) adding the following line to the file<br />
inc/conf/auth/resources/index.php:<br />
<pre>app_siteconnector = Off</pre>
Or b) adding the resource "app_siteconnector" via the admin tools in the<br />
Sitellite Control Panel.<br />
<br />
3. Define a siteconnector role by either a) copying the file<br />
inc/app/siteconnector/install/siteconnector.php to inc/conf/auth/roles/<br />
or b) creating a "siteconnector" role via the admin tools in the Sitellite<br />
Control Panel with the following settings:<br />
<pre>Name: siteconnector<br />Is admin?: Yes<br />Disabled: No<br />Allowed Resources: App Siteconnector (Read and Write)</pre>
You may set the allowed access levels and statuses to whatever you<br />
want.&nbsp; The default in the example file are All and All (Read and Write).<br />
<br />
4. Before a 3rd party can connect to your SiteConnector Web Services,<br />
you will need to create a user for them with the role "siteconnector" via<br />
the Sitellite Control Panel.<br />
<br />
You should now be ready to start using your new SiteConnector add-on.<br />
