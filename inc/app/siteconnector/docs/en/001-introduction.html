<h1>Introduction</h1>

SiteConnector is Sitellite's Web Services add-on, which allows you to
connect your Sitellite CMS with other applications using the SOAP or
XML-RPC protocols.&nbsp; SiteConnector makes it easy to create and
publish new services from standard PHP classes, including the
auto-generation of WSDL descriptors, which can be used by other
applications to talk to your Sitellite CMS, and to utilize other SOAP
or XML-RPC sources (ie. other applications) programmatically within
your Sitellite-based apps.<br />
<br />
Some additional of the benefits of SiteConnector include:<br />
<ul>
  <li>Simple and consistent API for accessing both SOAP and XML-RPC
sources, so you can both deploy and consume Web Services in both
protocols with no source code changes.</li>
  <li>Authentication provided automatically by Sitellite's built-in
authentication system, enabling controlled access with separate
password protected accounts for separate organizations.</li>
  <li>Uses standard Apache SSL (optional) for secure, encrypted communication, requiring no code changes whatsoever.</li>
  <li>Built-in usage tracking and monitoring (users, date/time, response code, IP addresses) to keep you informed at all times.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
