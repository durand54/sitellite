<h1>Documentation</h1>

You can access the documentation for SiteConnector via the AppDoc
add-on in the Sitellite Control Panel.&nbsp; This provides access to
documentation about the SiteConnector API, which is what you'll use to
create and consume Web Services with SiteConnector.<br />
<br />
Another place to start is to read and copy the source code of the
example services inc inc/app/siteconnector/lib/Service/ and the example
client tests in inc/app/siteconnector/boxes/client/&nbsp; These serve
as code examples to help get you started writing your own.<br />
