<h1>Installation</h1>

0. Requirements:<br />
<br />
SiteForum relies on the Org app, which is currently available via anonymous CVS<br />
access from sitellite.org.  Additionally, for search capabilities, SiteForum<br />
relies entirely on SiteSearch, which is used automatically if it is found<br />
installed on your web site.  If not, your SiteForum will have no search<br />
capabilities.<br />
<br />
1. Create the necessary database tables with the following commands:<br />
<br />
$ cd /PATH/TO/SITELLITE<br />
$ mysql -p -u USER DBNAME &lt; inc/app/siteforum/install/install-mysql.sql<br />
(enter password when prompted)<br />
<br />
2. Install siteforum_post collection into the CMS, enabling SiteSearch<br />
to index your forum.<br />
<br />
$ cp inc/app/siteforum/install/siteforum_post.php inc/app/cms/conf/collections/<br />
<br />
3. You are now ready to load your new forum by linking to:<br />
